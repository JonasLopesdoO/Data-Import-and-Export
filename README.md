## How to deploy your changes:
You can use sfdx by running the following command:
```
sfdx force:source:deploy -x path/to/package.xml
```

Or you can chose for doing that by clicking with the right button of the mouse on the 
```
package.xml file -> "Deploy Source in Manifest to Org"
```

Obs: Don't forget to authorize your org first :)
